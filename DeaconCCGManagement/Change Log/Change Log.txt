*Pass along contacts will display total and 'not followed up' counts
*Installed the NuGet package AntiXSS

*Set up the 'Needs Communion' feature. The deacons can now request communion for a member
	and the admin will see a list. They can also filter and purge that list.
*Added a property to some of the view models called 'ReturnUrl'. I use jQuery to 
	assign this property the 'back to list' url that's stored in the browser's
	session storage. After a user edits, creates, or deletes a record  they
	will get redirected to the back-to-list url.
*Finished the calendar feature. Deacons can now pull up a calendar of the members's
	birthdays, wedding anniversaries, and joined-Zion anniversaries. Admins will
	see all events.
*Deacons only see prayer requests from their own CCG now.
*Drop down list for CCG filter in Prayer Request list view now shows last names
	of users assigned to that CCG.

*Fixed members filter to work with pagination in CCG Members listing page.
*Now using the plug-in JS Storage to get/set breadcrumbs. Breadcrumbs are
	now stored in the browser's session storage. JavaScript file takes care of the logic.
*Removed all old code for breadcrumbs including the breadcrumb model.
*Database no longer has a table for breadcrumbs.
*Now using browser storage for all 'Back to List' links. One script sets the 
	link in browser storage and another one gets the link.  
*Removed all old code and parameters for passing 'Back to List' link
	to and from the web page.
*Now using variables in the Admin console partial views for the description/link boxes.
*Changed how the query string is made when using the 'Items Per Page' drop down menu.
	Now it uses the Request object to get a collection of queries and concats them
	together with the itemsPerPage or listAll as requested. New static method in ViewHelper 
	called GetUrlWithPerPageQuery takes care of the logic. This is much cleaner.
