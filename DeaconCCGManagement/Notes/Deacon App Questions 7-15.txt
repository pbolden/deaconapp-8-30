Deacon App Questions

1. When a deacon submits a prayer request, should this prayer request
	be visible to everyone, including other deacons?

2. When a deacon checks 'pass along' when submitting a contact record,
	this should make it visible to only the pastor, correct?

3. What do we want in the Summary Reports? I haven't started on this yet.
	Please give me a list of what we want in the report.

3. Deacon Announcements is another section that is incomplete.
	Do we just want to use texts and notifications for 
	the deacon announcements instead of making this another section. 
	If not, then what do we want in this section? Maybe we could have
	a section in the admin panel that would blast a text message and notification
	to all deacons.

4. Where should users get push notifications?
	Here are the places I have set up so far:
		* prayer request (everyone gets one after a prayer request is submitted)
		* pass along contact (one goes to the pastor only)
		* member's birthday/wedding anniversary/join Zion anniversary
		* change request (one goes to change request manager(s))
