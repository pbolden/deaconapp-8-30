Breadcrumb notes

Purpose: to make breadcrumbs "on the fly." Some pages
can be reached by different paths so static breadcrumbs
may not accurately represent the path to the current page.


* no more than 8 links per breadcrumbs. otherwise it will
  be too long. 
* if more than 8, truncate with an ellipses
  eg., ... / foo2 / foo3 / foo4 / foo5 / foo6 / foo7 / foo8
* if truncated, when user goes back the truncated should
	show back up. 
	eg., ... / foo2 / foo3 / foo4 / foo5 / foo6 / foo7 / foo8
	User clicks on 'foo6'; this will make foo1 show in foo6 page:
	foo1 / foo2 / foo3 / foo4 / foo5 / foo6
* if user circles around to a page by a different path, remove all
	pages after that.
	eg., foo1 / foo2 / foo3 / foo4 / foo5 / foo6 / foo7
	User goes to foo4 by some other route. foo5 - foo7
	should be removed
* when user goes back, last view(s) should be removed
	eg., foo1 / foo2 / foo3 / foo4 / foo5
	User clicks on foo4, foo5 should be removed from list.
	user clicks on foo3, foo4 and foo5 should be removed
* a page should not be in the list twice

** ALL GET and POST requests will need to send back the breadcrumb guid
	
* instantiate breadcrumb service object in base controller
* when user goes home, all breadcrumbs are cleared from list
* use ViewBag property for breadcrumb guid
* all views should have a unique name set assigned to a variable 
	within a Razor code block
* the url for all views should be set in controller by:
	Request?.Url?.PathAndQuery
	-this gets the url with the query string for get requests
	-no need to get posted data for post requests
	-assign to viewbag in all action methods
	-in post action methods, do not add breadcrumb
* use view partial to render breadcrumbs
