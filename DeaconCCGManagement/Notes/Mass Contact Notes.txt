Mass Contact feature

contact selected members button

Need a controller for bulk contacts

User will select members either by the select all
check box or one at a time. Then user can click
contact selected members button.
This will lead to a mass contact view.

Mass contact view:
	drop down of contacts (email, text, newsletter)
	if email selected, use email controller
	same for 'text'
	Need email and sms view models
		props for mass contact (bool) and list of members
	if mass contact is true, send back to mass contact controller
	show/hide list of members (we can do this with bootstrap)

need service class for email and sms
